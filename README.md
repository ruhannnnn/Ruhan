# 📌 Aspiring Software Engineer | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Year 11 Student

Good Morning/Afternoon, My name is Ruhan. I am a dedicated and highly motivated student with a clear vision for my future in the field of software engineering. I am currently in Year 11, actively developing my technical skills and academic foundation with the long-term objective of contributing to major technology companies such as Google or Apple.

💻 Technical Interests & Current Development

I am strongly committed to expanding my technical capabilities across multiple areas of computing:

-> Python – my strongest language, which I have studied extensively and use confidently across projects

-> C++ – currently learning to deepen my understanding of memory management, efficiency, and algorithmic thinking

-> HTML – developing foundational web development skills

-> Machine Learning – an emerging field I intend to pursue further through projects, research, and future academic study

My learning approach focuses on consistency, conceptual understanding, and practical application.

🎯 Academic & Professional Goals

I hold myself to a high standard of academic excellence and personal ambition. My current objectives include:

-> Achieving Grade 9s in all GCSE subjects

-> Building a rigorous and competitive portfolio of programming projects

-> Strengthening my profile for admission to world-class universities, including Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge

-> Developing expertise in core computing disciplines to prepare for future work in machine learning and software engineering

I am committed to continuous improvement and disciplined study to ensure long-term success.

🌱 Personal Interests

Outside of my academic responsibilities, I maintain a balanced set of hobbies that support my creativity and analytical thinking:

-> Video games, which often inspire my interest in interactive systems and game development

-> Anime, providing cultural and artistic inspiration

-> Independent study, particularly in advanced computing concepts

I treat my free time as an opportunity to grow—whether through learning, reflection, or new experiences.

📌 Long-Term Vision

My overarching aim is to become a skilled and forward-thinking software engineer capable of contributing meaningfully to cutting-edge technologies. I aspire to:

-> Develop efficient, scalable systems

-> Work on impactful machine learning applications

-> Lead or contribute to innovative projects at globally respected technology companies

Every project on this GitHub represents a step toward that long-term vision.
